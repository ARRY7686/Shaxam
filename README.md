# Shaxam

**Shaxam** is a Python-based audio fingerprinting and matching tool inspired by the Shazam algorithm. It enables you to add songs to a MySQL-backed fingerprint database and match unknown audio clips against it.

## ðŸŽ§ Features

- Generate audio fingerprints using frequency peaks and SHA-1 hashing.
- Store and manage fingerprints in a **MySQL database**.
- Match audio clips against stored songs and return confidence scores.
- Visualize alignment between input and matched songs.
- Record audio clips directly from your microphone for matching.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if using `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Database Setup

Create a MySQL database and provide the connection details using a `.env` file in the project root:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=shaxam
```

Run the initial SQL setup script (if provided) or create the necessary `songs` and `fingerprints` tables.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Add a song to the database:
```bash
python main.py add path/to/song.mp3
```
Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the song name, which will be stored with its fingerprint in MySQL.

### Match a clip against the database:
```bash
python main.py match path/to/clip.mp3
```

### Record from microphone and match:
```bash
python main.py mic {duration}
```
This command records a short audio clip via your microphone and attempts to match it against the database.

### Example Output
```
Matched: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Confidence: 87.5%)
```

A match alignment plot will also be displayed showing the timestamp correlation between the input clip and matched songs.
