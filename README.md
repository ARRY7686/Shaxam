# Shaxam

**Shaxam** is a Python-based audio fingerprinting and matching tool inspired by the Shazam algorithm. It enables you to add songs to a fingerprint database and match unknown audio clips against it.

## ðŸŽ§ Features

- Generate audio fingerprints using frequency peaks and SHA-1 hashing.
- Store and manage a fingerprint database in JSON format.
- Match audio clips against stored songs and return confidence scores.
- Visualize alignment between input and matched songs.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Add a song to the database:
```bash
python main.py add path/to/song.mp3
```
Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the song name, which will be stored with its fingerprint.

### Match a clip against the database:
```bash
python main.py match path/to/clip.mp3
```

### Example Output
```
Matched: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Confidence: 87.5%)
```

A match alignment plot will also be displayed showing the timestamp correlation between the input clip and matched songs.
